          Welcome to Jonathan Zavialov's Virtual Museum. This exhibit focuses on
          the earthquake in Sparta in 464 BCE. You will learn about its
          immediate effects, as well as its lasting influence on Ancient Greek
          history, including its context in the Peloponnesian War.

          <p>
            Within Ancient Greece, tensions were very high during the 460s BCE.
            Some of the most powerful cities were Athens and Sparta. Only 20
            years earlier, they had fought together in the Persian War. Notably,
            in the battle at Thermopylae and Salamis, Spartan troops bravely
            delayed the Persians, giving Athens enough time to evacuate its
            cities to safety. (Zhou 107)
          </p>
          <p>
            However, over the next two decades, the two cities grew increasingly
            opposed to each other. The two cities had many differences, which
            may have contributed. Athens was a democracy, while Sparta was an
            oligarchy. Athens was a maritime power, while Sparta was a land
            power. Athens was a city-state, while Sparta was a military state.
            Athens was a city of culture, while Sparta was a city of war. Athens
            was a city of the people, while Sparta was a city of the elite.
          </p>
          <p>
            In these 20 years, the Delian League was created. Many cities were
            part of it, but notably, not Sparta. With the progression of time,
            Athens became increasingly more powerful. As some cities began to
            leave, Athens became the superpower within the league, taking over
            control of much of Greece in the process. Tensions became even
            higher when Sparta invaded Attica, the region that Athens was
            located in.

          <h1>The Earthquake</h1>
          <p>
            The earthquake occurred in 464 BCE. It was very strong, having a
            magnitude of 7.2. To put this into perspective, the earthquake that
            happened in Haiti in 2010, killing over 200,000, had a magnitude of
            7. According to ancient historian Thucydides, over 20,000 people
            died in the Spartan earthquake. However, modern historians say this
            might have been an exaggeration.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Helots were the working class of Sparta, often working in the
            farms within the surrounding area. They were often treated poorly,
            only being allowed to live in the city if they were deemed fit
            enough to work. The earthquake left the city in chaos, with the
            Helots taking advantage of the situation. They revolted, taking
            control of Sparta.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of the revolt, Sparta requested Athens's help to regain
            control of the city. In response, Athens sent 4,000 soldiers to
            help. However, on their way to Sparta, something happened which led
            to Sparta refusing them. Historians are unsure of exactly what
            happened, but regardless of what it was, it was enough to cause
            Sparta to refuse Athens' help (Zhou 108). Sparta's refusal was seen
            as an act of hostility towards Athens, which was one of the key
            factors in causing the First Peloponnesian war.
